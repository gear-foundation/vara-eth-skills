description: Build and verify Vara.eth deploy, interaction, and integration examples after a contract already exists. Use when an AI agent is asked to upload or create a program, initialize it, fund executable balance, send messages, read state, handle replies, use `ethexe` CLI, script flows with `@vara-eth/api`, or create/interact through a Solidity ABI interface.

# Vara.eth App Builder

Use this skill after a Vara.eth contract already exists. Contract authoring belongs to `vara-eth-contract-writer`; this skill starts from built artifacts, IDL, code id, program id, Router/Mirror addresses, or integration requirements.

## Choose The Flow

Pick the narrowest workflow for the task:

- Direct CLI lifecycle: read `../../playbooks/vara-eth-ethexe-cli-workflow.md`.
- Scripted TypeScript lifecycle: read `../../playbooks/vara-eth-ts-api-workflow.md`.
- Solidity ABI interface lifecycle: read `../../playbooks/vara-eth-abi-interface.md`.

Use `../../references/source-map.md` when a claim depends on implementation details. Use `../../references/flow-checks.md` as the final review checklist for deploy/interact examples.

## Shared Rules

- Build examples from verified public surfaces, not guessed helper APIs.
- Keep placeholders explicit for private keys, sender addresses, Router addresses, RPC endpoints, salts, code ids, program ids, and ABI interface addresses.
- Do not print real private keys in reusable examples.
- Separate current behavior from planned or future behavior.
- State whether a flow uses Router, Mirror, direct Sails payloads, generated Solidity ABI, or TypeScript helpers.
- Use Vara units carefully: wVARA has 12 decimals, so `1 WVARA = 1000000000000`.
- Confirm whether a step uses owned balance, executable balance, native value, or wVARA.
- For message processing, executable balance top-up may be required even when program creation already succeeded.
- For networked flows, verify the observable result, not only that a transaction was submitted.

## `ethexe` Binary

For deploy and interaction flows, require the `ethexe` binary explicitly.

It can be obtained by either:

- building from source after `git clone https://github.com/gear-tech/gear.git`, or
- downloading from `https://get.gear.rs/#vara-eth`.

Before documenting exact CLI commands, verify real command names, flags, and output fields against the current binary or implementation.

## CLI Flow Summary

Use the CLI playbook for the exact sequence. The expected shape is:

1. Import the sender key with `ethexe key keyring import --private-key ...`.
2. Run `ethexe tx` with shared flags before the subcommand: `--ethereum-rpc`, `--ethereum-router`, and `--sender`.
3. Upload code with `upload --watch` and treat approval as the validation gate.
4. Capture the returned `code_id`.
5. Create the program with `create` or `create-with-abi`.
6. Top up executable balance when required.
7. Initialize the program.
8. Query state or send messages and verify replies/output.

Do not skip validation or create a program from an unapproved code id.

## TypeScript Flow Summary

For TypeScript examples, prefer small runnable scripts over broad app scaffolds.

Use the verified shape from the TS playbook:

- `createVaraEthApi(...)` for Vara.eth helpers.
- `getMirrorClient({ address, publicClient, signer })` for Mirror interaction.
- `SailsProgram` plus `SailsIdlParser` from `sails-js/parser` for IDL v2.
- `program.setProgramId(...)` before encoding, decoding, calls, or queries that need the program id.
- `program.setApi(gearApi)` only when using SailsProgram's own `@gear-js/api`-backed calls; do not pass the `@vara-eth/api` object to `setApi`.
- Hex Sails payloads for `mirror.sendMessage(...)`.
- `setupReplyListener()` followed by `await waitForReply()`.

For IDL v2 parsing, use `sails-js` from the verified GitHub release tarball unless a newer release has been checked:

```json
{
  "sails-js": "https://github.com/gear-tech/sails/releases/download/js/v1.0.0-beta.1/sails-js.tgz"
}
```

Do not use the old standalone `sails-js-parser` package for IDL v2 examples.

## ABI Flow Summary

Do not call direct `mirror.sendMessage(...)` plus Sails IDL payloads an ABI flow.

An ABI-enabled workflow has these pieces:

1. Generate a Solidity ABI interface from the Sails IDL.
2. Deploy the generated ABI interface contract.
3. Create the Vara.eth program with `createProgramWithAbiInterface(...)` and the deployed ABI interface address.
4. Top up executable balance before init or message processing when required.
5. Initialize and call the program through ABI-facing Ethereum tooling or generated bindings.
6. Poll or repeat read-only checks when verifying state.

Ethereum transaction receipts can arrive before Vara.eth state is visible through read-only calls. Examples should make this explicit and verify state with polling or repeated reads where needed.

## Replies And State Reads

Decode reply codes in runnable examples:

- `0x00000000` = success, auto reply.
- `0x00010000` = success, manual reply.

For state reads, verify the expected source:

- Sails queries through `calculateReplyForHandle` or equivalent query helpers.
- ABI-facing reads through the generated Solidity ABI interface.
- Mirror interactions through Sails payloads and reply listeners.

When querying by account, be explicit about Ethereum address versus `ActorId` conversion. Ethereum addresses are 20 bytes; `ActorId` is 32 bytes.

## Implementation Checks

Before naming an API, command, event, field, or flag, verify the relevant implementation area:

- Contract names, function names, events, payable behavior, and errors: `contracts/src` or `ethereum/abi`.
- CLI commands, flags, defaults, and output fields: `cli/src`.
- JSON-RPC methods, params, result fields, and errors: `rpc/src`.
- Runtime behavior such as executable balance, owned balance, pre-confirmation state, init restrictions, and reply handling: `runtime`, `processor`, and `service`.
- Rust SDK wrappers: `sdk/src`.
- TypeScript SDK behavior outside `ethexe`: verify in its own repository before treating it as public API.

## Example Quality Bar

Examples should include:

- Required inputs and environment variables.
- Exact command or call.
- Expected success signal.
- Expected output fields.
- Known failure modes.
- What was verified and what remains unverified.

Keep examples minimal enough to run or adapt, and scoped to an already-written contract.
